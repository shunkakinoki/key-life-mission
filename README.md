OBLITERATE THE GALAXY

## Egoistic

INVENT A PRODUCT / SERVICE THAT IS TRULY GALAXY-SHATTERING

### Steve Jobs Quote

> “We’re here to put a dent in the universe. Otherwise why else even be here?”
> ― Steve Jobs

### iPhone Release Date

June 29, 2007

### My Experience

Can never forget this day...

My mind was blown.

### What Drives Me

To do something bigger, better, and meaningful.

### To put it shortly

Invent a product to an extent that is "galaxy-shattering".

## Altruistic

INITIATE A CHAIN REACTION OF INFATUATION IN THE HUMAN SOCIETY

### My Experience

Due to the invention of the iPhone,

Whole new worlds have opened up

The advent of an entirely new SNS,

the mobile payment economic industry,

etc...

### From Another Perspective

This can be said as a form of "infatuation" occuring in the human society.

### Isn't this Incredible ???

ISN'T THIS INCREDIBLE???

### ONE DEVICE

ONE DEVICE

THAT WAS THE INITATOR OF THE "INFATUATION" THAT ENGULFED

BILLIONS OF PEOPLE

THROUGHOUT THE COMING TIMES...

## Societary

DO WHAT IS TRULY RIGHT IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE GREATER GOOD

### A Common Case

We often see the phrase

"To make people happier"

"For a brighter future"

"To push the human race forward"

### What is happiness ???

Is this even indisputable ???

### "The Greater Good" Differs Between Each Perspcetive

The Earth

The Humanity

The Country

### Then What ???

There is a decent chance that

"Technological Advancement"

will NOT contribute to "The Greater Good"

### What CAN We DO

Subjectively Contribute To Build a Future For

"The Greater Good"

in general.
